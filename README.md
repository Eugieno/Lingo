## Description 
Welcome to the Word Association game, a fun and challenging way to test your vocabulary and language skills! This game will challenge you to make connections between words based on their antonymic, synonymic, rhythmic, connotative, or denotative relationships.

With each round of the game, you will be presented with a set of words and tasked with selecting a word that is related to them in a specific way. For example, you may be asked to select a word that is rhythmically related to the words Jiggle, Juggle, and Gaggle, with the correct answer being "Giggle." Or you may be asked to select a word that is connotatively related to the words Enchanted and Bright, with the correct answer being "Hollywood."

The game's question bank is generated through the use of Word Quiz and Words API, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive set of inquiries. You can customize the difficulty level, time limit, and number of questions to personalize your gaming experience.

After completing a game, you can track your progress on a shared leaderboard, competing against other players for top placement. This game is perfect for anyone looking to have fun, learn new words, and sharpen their language skills. So, what are you waiting for?

## Reflection 
At the outset of the project, our team engaged in a collaborative brainstorming session to generate ideas for a fun and educational language learning game. After considering numerous possibilities, we ultimately settled on the Lingo game, which challenged players to demonstrate their vocabulary and understanding of the English language by selecting the correct synonym among a list of options.

As we began the implementation phase, we encountered a number of technical challenges that required us to iterate and refine our approach through trial and error. Through persistence and a willingness to learn from our mistakes, we were able to overcome these obstacles and develop a game that we are proud to share with others.

Overall, the process of creating the Lingo game was a valuable learning experience that required us to apply our technical skills while also remaining attuned to the user experience and overall game design. We hope that players will enjoy and benefit from this game as much as we did in creating it.

## Upcoming Features

* Add a dictionary tab so players can search for the meaning of words and their usage in different contexts. 
* Another exciting feature is player match, which allows players to search for and challenge specific opponents such as friends and family. 
* Introduce alternative languages – expand the game so that it can be used to expand a player's linguistic skills by having them play the game in a different language. This makes LINGO to increase its customer base.
For those looking for a different game experience, a hangman-style game with blank lines representing the connective word will be introduced as an alternative UI experience. 
These new additions will make Lingo even more inclusive, fun, and diverse, expanding its appeal to an even wider audience
